Shaun Brumder is dying to get into Stanford to take a class his favorite author is teaching. Everything that could go wrong possibly does. His counselor sends another Shaun's transcript to Stanford, a slacker Shaun with rotten grades, and when he sets up a meeting with someone from the school, his family ruins it for him. The family, consisting of a druggie brother, a falling apart, disabled rich husband, and a boozy wife who manage to bleed, embarrass and ruin things for Shaun. Shaun's druggie brother has a new idea, and Shaun is desperate enough to ride along with him. No matter how many times I see this movie, I laugh a lot. I think this is a very underrated film. Shaun's family gets most of the laughs, but you feel so bad for him. You want him to be able to go to the school he wants to, but at the same time, when you see him be nasty to his friends and girlfriend, you wish you could tell him to stop being a jerk and lighten up. it's a very over the top story, but a very funny, very underrated film.""]"

I mostly liked it to see the uncredited cameo of Kevin Kline playing Marcus Skinner. When Shaun (Colin Hanks) picked up Marcus\'s book, I got excitedly struck when Kevin\'s voice said ""Read me."" I was shocked. I thought of the great times that I had when I was in high school. In situations where it\'s involved with drugs, it made me think of Alice in Wonderland because many people who took drugs think that it\'s something you watch when you take them. In a Disney UK opening of a VHS, a voice mentioned it as: ""Where nothing is as it seems."" I also didn\'t realize that Schuyler Fisk is the daughter of Sissy Spacek and  Jack Fisk. I had to find it funny when Don Durkett took the pain medicine and acted like he was woozy. I\'m not so much into Romeo and Juliet. 2 of my 7 men made uncredited cameo appearances. Kevin of course as I mentioned earlier played Marcus Skinner and Ben Stiller played a firefighter. On the back of the DVD I brought home it wrote Martin Skinner. That\'s a typing error. In scenes where Shaun met Marcus, I had to pretend to be him (Shaun) and say stuff like ""My hands are numb. My legs are shaking. And my heart is racing."" I say that because that was how I felt when I met Kevin at age 16. It\'s sort of a mixture of I think of random stuff and I think of the wonderful times I\'ve had with him. The only thing I would change for this is to make Marcus a bigger role and Kevin\'s name on the credits of any kind. Then at least I would enjoy it more. But that would\'ve been a spoiler alert so I\'m pleased that it\'s uncredited.  I imagined myself seeing it on the big screen in 2002 and I would\'ve sat and enjoyed the movie. Then I get surprised and shocked that he makes a cameo and people would ask ""Is that Kevin Kline?"" If I did, I would\'ve never see him as anything but as Phoebus. Now I see him as more than that. Throughout the course of the film, I kept hoping that Shaun would get into Stanford. Then at the end of it, I realized the difference and said ""No. Let him stay in Orange County so that he can spend time with is friends and Ashley."" This is amazing.']"

He shares his dad\'s tendency for sounding like he\'s whining when he\'s angry. For that reason, he didn\'t really carry the movie. Other than that, we have a slick and likable movie stylistically speaking: I really liked the style and tone of this movie, it\'s just that the movie didn\'t end up saying much or being that funny. Jack Black offers what he can, and he can be great, but if the material is just not that strong, it just turns into Black being kind of a ham with no real purpose. This movie, due to its weak dialogue and lead character just kind of flops and falls short, even though it is supposed to fit into the Holden Caulfield genre of film. None of the movies I\'ve seen capture the artistry or lyricism of ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" and this one falls short as well. It also has some cynical elements and some gross out moments, which detract from it as well. It is a shame, because I really like the look and the directing of this film, and it seems like it could have gone some good places. The movie just ended up being kind of ""blah.""']"

Orange County captures the thrill, angst, and humor in the college application process so well. Colin Hanks as Shane wants to get into Stanford and tries everything to get the university to reconsider his application. The plot is outlandish with many tropes dating back to at least Animal House, including the admissions office burning down, crazy frat parties, and boyfriend falling from the roof when spying on his girlfriend. Still, it works as a funny but not particularly exceptional movie.', ""The plot develops pretty well until the point where Colin Hanks and Schuyler Fisk break up. Their relationship goes through the same ups and downs found in most romantic comedies, but it happens way too quickly. It's never clear why the two split up, and it's simply unconvincing that they get back together so quickly. It's almost as if there are a few missing scenes in between."", 'One thing I did appreciate about the movie is that despite its exaggerated humor actually mixes outlandish humor with more subtle moments. Stanford cannot live up to Shane\'s ideals, but nor is it a complete disappointment. Likewise, Shane\'s dysfunctional family is outrageous but also shows some virtue early on in the movie. The characters all act like complete idiots at times, but are also genuine and sweet. Unfortunately, the ending undermines this balance by veering too close to the typical Hollywood formula of ""local boy choosing to stay home to be with his girlfriend"".', ""Overall, I'd give the movie 3.5 stars.

They may have their own odd ways of showing it, but care for each other they do. The friendship is real and the love is real. The movie is also kind towards the characters, not mocking them like most stupid kid movies do, but laughing with the bad deck of cards they are dealt.

Colin Hanks' character is a surfer dude turned intellectual upon becoming enamored with a book he finds on the beach (Kevin Kline has a cameo in the film as the book's author).

Shaun spends most of his days surfing with his three best buds who enjoy getting wasted and catching the highest waves possible. When one of his friends suddenly dies while surfing in a freak storm, Shaun realizes that life is short...especially after he finds a book in the beach sand, written by the famous Stanford University professor, Marcus Skinner (Kevin Kline). This leads Shaun into wanting to become a writer, and wanting to attend Stanford University, so he could take one of Skinner\'s classes. However, the only problem is that Shaun\'s dysfunctional family doesn\'t want him to go to Stanford. His mom, Cindy Beugler (Catherine O\'Hera), who got remarried to an old man, Bob Beugler (George Murdock), wants him to go to a college that\'s closer to home. His filthy rich dad, Bud Brumder (John Lithgow), who got remarried to a very unfaithful younger woman, claims Shaun doesn\'t need to become a writer and that being an author doesn\'t ""get you rich"". So this leaves Shaun to take matters into his own hands. Shaun applies to Stanford, anyway. When his school councelor sends the wrong transcript and application to Stanford, Shaun gets rejected. Shaun can\'t accept this, so when his wasted older brother, Lance Brumder (Jack Black), suggests they take a road trip to the school to try to prove to the school that he is Stanford material, Shaun takes this suggestion seriously. So Lance ends up driving Shaun and Shaun\'s girlfriend, Ashley (Schuyler Fisk), on a hilarious road trip to Stanford, so that Shaun can hopefully get accepted into the school...and Shaun will do whatever it takes, unkowningly that his family and friends want him to stay home, because they care about him.', 'OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Orange County"" was extremely hilarious, original, and clever.

In most films of this genre, the main character is almost invariably a young man whose aspirations rise no higher than that of getting laid, hanging ten with his buddies, or partaking of every illegal narcotic known to mankind.  Shaun Brumder, however, has loftier goals.  His main dream is to gain acceptance into Stanford University where he will be able to study under the renowned Martin Skinner, a successful author whose work has inspired Shaun to want to become a writer himself.

Harold Ramis, Lily Tomlin, Chevy Chase, Kevin Kline and a host of other big name stars make effective cameo appearances in the film.', 'At times one wishes that writer Mike White and director Jake Kasdan had aspired to create a richer, subtler comedy than the one they\'ve ultimately come up with.  Shaun\'s story might have been more interesting had the filmmakers not always been so eager to go for the broad caricature, the tired pratfall, the easy laugh.  ""Orange County"" may be better than most films of its ilk, but that really isn\'t saying much in the long run.  It\'s ultimately, when all is said and done, a pretty dumbed-down little comedy.

Kasdan also directed some episodes of the TV series ""Freaks & Geeks,"" the best portrayal of HS life ever to be shown on TV, so the guy came to this film with a quality resume under his belt.', '""Orange County"" deals with Colin Hanks\' quest to get into Stanford and become a writer to escape his dreadful family in the burbs. Like most teen movies, most of the adults are buffoons (the film features Chevy Chase...need I say more?), and Hanks\' friends are stoked-out surfer stoners who provide worthy comic relief. MTV cult hero Jack Black stars as Hanks\' sleazy older brother, and although he plays a much smaller role in this film as the trailer makes you believe, he sets up Hanks for some painfully funny plot twists. He is truly talented and can best be described as Jon Belushi played at 45 rather than 33 RPM. More comedy stars like Kathleen O\'Hara, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, Ben Stiller and John Lithgow round out the cast.', ""The film wasn't a totally realistic portrayal of a suburban kid at 17, but it was funny while still holding on to some depth and substance.

What bugged me the most was how only about 22% of the movie was actually filmed in Orange County, while the rest of it was filmed in either upstate Bakersfield, or Los Angeles.

The only person that is influencing Shaun to go to college is his sweet girlfriend, Ashley (Schuyler Fisk, Sissy Spacek\'s daughter). Shaun decides to go to Stanford, but his dumb guidence counseler (cameoed by the funny Lily Tomlin) sends the wrong transcipt to their campus, ultimately putting the option of going to Stanford out of the question.
